# Modeling Opportunistic Exploitation -- This is the code for the first chapter of Stephanie Thurner's MS Thesis

 Please email sthurner at uw . edu with any questions -- I learned a lot from this project on what not to do coding wise, live and learn, and am happy to help clarify.

 Chapter title: Modeling opportunistic exploitation: increased extinction risk when targeting more than one species
 
 Habitat quality grids are generated in *Grid Generation folder*.
 
 Single species and two species base case: *Base Case Folder*
 
 Allee effect case: *Allee folder*
 
 Anthropogenic allee effect case: *Anth. Allee folder*
 
 Folders with parameter names as titles are looking at the impact of that parameter.
 
 
 *Plot all scenarios*: Plotting single species, two species, anth allee, and allee
 
 *Plot all simulations*: Plotting the 'sensitivity tests' for different parameters
