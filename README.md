# Modeling Opportunistic Exploitation
 Code for manuscript: Modeling opportunistic exploitation: increased extinction risk when targeting more than one species
 
 Habitat quality grids are generated in Grid Generation folder.
 
 Single species and two species base case: Base Case Folder
 Allee effect case: Allee folder
 Anthropogenic allee effect case: Anth. Allee folder
 
 Folders with parameter names as titles are looking at the impact of that parameter.
 
 
 Plot all scenarios: Plotting single species, two species, anth allee, and allee
 
 Plot all simulations: Plotting the 'sensitivity tests' for different parameters
